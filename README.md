# Resonant-NetWork-GUI
This repository is work space for Matlab GUI design for resonant network.

The main task of the calculator is trying to find out the optimized design of the resonant network.
Based on the inputs of the converter, a series calculation will be implementd, and the curves will be ploted.
All the necessary results will be illustrated...
